# Retail-Store-Sales-Data-Analysis
Sql project
My SQL project focused on sales analysis for a retail chain called 'RetailMart.' I worked with a database containing tables for stores, products, and sales. The goal was to help the company make data-driven business decisions by analyzing sales performance across different regions and product categories. 

I developed several key queries, such as calculating total sales by region, identifying the top 5 best-selling products, and breaking down sales by product category. I also calculated monthly sales growth to track performance over time. Additionally, I analyzed store performance and identified regional trends to help with marketing strategies. This project helped me strengthen my SQL skills, particularly in writing complex queries to extract actionable insights from large datasets."

This explanation is brief, highlights the project objectives, and mentions key queries and their purpose, all while showcasing your SQL skills.
